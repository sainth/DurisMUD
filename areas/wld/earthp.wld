&+yA Newly &+LCut &+ySection of Earth~
  &+YA roughly-hewn cavern opens in the otherwise solid rock here, excavated
&+Yrecently by skilled hands and tools.  The smooth walls twist and bend
&+Ythrough the area at seemingly random intervals, but continue more or less in
&+Ythe same direction.  The varied stone and earth that comprises this layer of
&+Ythe &+yPlane of Earth &+Ygives a mottled appearance to the walls of the
&+Ytunnel, as if flecks of multi-colored dust were spun in a great storm and
&+Yhurled into the rock face.  The passage transmits sound with uncanny
&+Yaccuracy, only adding a slight echo as it passes through.  The temperature
&+Yhere is comfortable, if not a little cool.&n

&+yA Newly &+LCut &+ySection of Earth~
  &+YA roughly-hewn cavern opens in the otherwise solid rock here, excavated
&+Yrecently by skilled hands and tools.  The smooth walls twist and bend
&+Ythrough the area at seemingly random intervals, but continue more or less in
&+Ythe same direction.  The varied stone and earth that comprises this layer of
&+Ythe &+yPlane of Earth &+Ygives a mottled appearance to the walls of the
&+Ytunnel, as if flecks of multi-colored dust were spun in a great storm and
&+Yhurled into the rock face.  The passage transmits sound with uncanny
&+Yaccuracy, only adding a slight echo as it passes through.  The temperature
&+Yhere is comfortable, if not a little cool.&n

&+yA Magnificent &+LCavern &+yof &+YIncredible Size&n~
   &+yAlmost beyond comprehension, this cavern opens as a gigantic bubble within
&+ythe &+YPlane of Earth&+y.  The ceiling of the cavern rises so high that wispy
&+yclouds of &+bcondensation &+yhave formed in the upper portion of the cavern.
&+yWhile the size of the cavern is amazing in and of itself, it is drastically
&+yoverwhelmed by the presence of an ever-flowing stream of fine particles of
&+ydust that fall from a high location on the far western wall, and spills over
&+ythe majestic &+Learthen &+Lpalace &+yof &+LGrumbar&+y, the Earthlord.  The stream falls
&+ylike sand from an hourglass, spilling over the domed central portion of the
&+yfortress, and off the sides, falling into a deep abyss which surrounds the
&+yisland of stone upon which the &+LEarthlord's &+yhome rests.  A lengthy
&+ypeninsula stretches out from here to the island of stone at the center,
&+ywhere the entrance to the fortress awaits.&n

&+Lare stone melded with steel in a strange alchemical mastery that

&+Lof stone that lie to either side of the entryway are flecked with

&+yup the bottom of the tunnel is soft, almost the consistency of a fine loam.
&+yRivulets of cloudy water are are pushed to the surface when something heavy
&+yrests upon the surface.  The passage continues to the north and south.&n

&+yA Small &+LAlcove&+y in the &+YPassageway~
  &+yThis ornately carved room appears to be the home or getaway for some creature
&+ythat inhabits the plane.  The alcove is a small cubby hole cut out of the &+Learth
&+ywith intricate carvings upon nearly every surface of the walls.  There are even
&+ycarvings into the wooden beams which seem to support the ceiling here.  Some of the
&+ydesigns are bas-relief, and contain multicolored rocks and gems that accent the
&+yworks of art.  There is a passage to the east.

carvings~
  &+LAs you examine the carvings on the wall, they appear to be a sort of
&+Lgrand picture joining all the walls of the alcove together.  The picture
&+Lseems to be of thousands of &+ytiny&+L humanoids all with axes in hands working
&+Lin tunnel system.

&+yAn &+YEnormous &+LCavern~
   &+rDeep reds &+Land &+Ybright yellows &+Lcolor the surface of this enormous
&+Lcavern somewhere within the &+yPlane of Earth&+L.  The &+rstreaks of iron &+Lwithin the
&+Lstrata twisted and bend through the other layers of &+Ysedimentary rock &+Ladding
&+Lto the mosaic of colors that give this area a vibrant feeling of life.
&+LA deep humming can be heard from somewhere beyond the walls, and though
&+Lit is constant, it gets no closer or farther.  The sounds of things
&+Lmoving through the &+Ycavern &+Lcan be heard, but there is seldom any movement
&+Lto be seen.  The &+rcreatures &+Lthat inhabit this place are so much a part of
&+Lit, that they can pass in and out of the rock at will, surprising their
&+Lprey and luring unsuspecting foes to their doom.&N

&+YA &+yCavern &+YCarved from &+LBasalt&n~~~
   &+LThis cavern has been carefully carved out of a massive deposit of dark
&+Lbasalt.  The almost foam-like vesicles and openings in the rock give it an
&+Lexpansive but light appearance.  No doubt the moisture that exists in the
&+Lcavern is due to the many billions of tiny pockets where it can avoid
&+Ldrafts and pool once more.  A pervasive heat exists in the entire chamber,
&+Lprobably due to volcanic activity somewhere in the vicinity.  The basalt
&+Lformations also indicate volcanic activity, but perhaps thousands of years
&+Lprior.  Platforms, ledges, ramps and other strata lead in many directions.&n

&+YA &+yCavern &+YCarved from &+LBasalt&n~
   &+LThis cavern has been carefully carved out of a massive deposit of dark
&+Lbasalt.  The almost foam-like vesicles and openings in the rock give it an
&+Lexpansive but light appearance.  No doubt the moisture that exists in the
&+Lcavern is due to the many billions of tiny pockets where it can avoid
&+Ldrafts and pool once more.  A pervasive heat exists in the entire chamber,
&+Lprobably due to volcanic activity somewhere in the vicinity.  The basalt
&+Lformations also indicate volcanic activity, but perhaps thousands of years
&+Lprior.  Platforms, ledges, ramps and other strata lead in many directions.&n

&+LA &+RPrison &+Lbeneath the &+yEarth&n~
   &+rShaped like an oubliette, this chamber has only a single entrance at the top of
&+ra spheroid void in the &+yEarth&+r.  The walls of this chamber are lined with a
&+rstrange metallic rock with a deep red hue.  The rock hums and vibrates at a low
&+rlevel until living creatures come nearby, and increases exponentially the closer
&+rthey get.  Barely visible magical runes run across the metallic walls, briefly
&+rthrobbing with a &+mbarely noticable glow&+r.  There is a stillness in the air and
&+ran unnatural silence that swallows sound as it is created.&n

&+yA Winding &+YPassageway~
   &+yThere is a howling wind blowing through the passage here, whipping around everything
&+yand stirring up clouds of dust.  The passageway is heavily scarred with claw marks and
&+ygouges, suggesting the tunnel was excavated without real tools.  The passageway bends
&+yand twists at somewhat random intervals, keeping sight limited to the immediate area
&+yand obscuring what may be around the next bend.&n
