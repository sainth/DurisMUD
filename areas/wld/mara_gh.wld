&+Lreading '&+yTavern &+Lof the &+wM&+Wo&+won&+L'.  An exquisite &+ychandelier &+Llined with transluscent

&+LLittle droplets of &+bw&+Ba&+Ct&+Be&+br &+Ldrips from the ceiling and as you look up, you
&+Lnotice a colony of sleeping bats hanging overhead.  With the dim light, you
&+Lnotice a small passageway located behind an old bookcase which u feel
&+Lcompelled to explore...

A Ravine to a &+LSecret Entrance &Nof &+GTikitzopl~
   The jagged and very windy mountains encircled a small ravine that has
been opened by some sort of means of &+bmag&+Bic&N or perhaps by brute force.
The ravine is about wide enough for a dozen people to stand in shoulder-to-
shoulder, and vears off into a secret tunnel to the north.  Two slender
railings line paralell to eachother as they continue through down the tunnel.
Both railings tipped with an &+Lorcish&N skull, made completely out of &+Ygold&N.
The deep-set eyes of the skulls are ablaze in a deep blue &+bf&+Bl&+Wa&+Bm&+be&n. This
place, perhaps, looks like the once-constructed site of a secret entryway into
&+GTikitzopl&N, or, perhaps, a captured outpost of the city that now serves
some other purpose.
   On the floor is a large, &+Csil&+cve&+Cr &+Wplaque&N.

&+LA &+bHidden &+LStaircase Into &+GTikitzopl&N~
   The stone staircase leads further down into the tunnel from here.  A faint
&+rhumming&N sound can be heard coming from below.  To the south, the writhing
sounds of the &+Wpillars&N of &+rgore&N can be heard as they violently slosh about.
When traveling further down into this tunnel, one experiences much uneasyness.
It is not a feeling of discomfort at all, but of enlightenment.  Many things
can be seen and felt around onself when going towards the source of the
&+rhumming&N sounds, below.  Many ethereal, if not &+Ls&Np&+We&Nc&+Lt&Nr&+Wa&Nl, &+Bim&+Cag&+Bes&N are bombarded
into one's mind as the trek downward continues deeper and deeper, darker and
&+Ldarker&N.
   Three vibrant &+Csilver&N &+Wtorches&N are placed every few feet, providing
somewhat of a &+bmag&+Bical &+Willum&+Bi&+Cn&+Ba&+Wtion&N.  The torches each burn with an
intense and unique &+gli&+Rg&+Bht&N, and when the living flames of these torches
coalesce, they form even brighter and elaborate colors.

   There are several images that seem to appear in your mind as you continue
your journey down the stairways.  These revelations can not all be focused on

The various images that spring into your mind are as follows:

&NThe &+Wv&+Ci&+Ws&+Ca&+Wg&+Ce&N of an &+LOrc&N, releasing a scream of &+rBl&+Roo&+rdL&+Rus&+rt&N.

&+LThe Bottom of the&+y Cleft&n~
The cleft ends here with a shimmering black portal that flows like shimmering
water. The trees and grass around the portal have all been withered, as if the
portal itself was draining the energy of nearby creatures. Even the peaceful
sounds of Evermeet seem far away from here, the portal leads back to a dark
and horrible place.

&+LFollowing the &+yCleft&+L Down&n~
Sparkling water drips down from above, covering the grass at your feet in a
sweet smelling dew. Birds chrip happilly in the leaves above, and pushing the
branches away from you face reveals a path that leads deeper still. Should you
follow it?

&+LA&+y Cleft&+L Leading Deeper Into the&+g For&+Ges&+gt&n~
Four rocks stand here in a circle, whispering inaudible incantations of
powers long lost. Now they guard a sacred treasure that links this
beautiful refuge to the horrors of the outside world, and these whispering
goliaths prevent the unworthy from entering.
